# GameBuilds
Contains builds of some of my games. These are a work in progress and by no means a finished product.
Each folder contains a short README regarding the gameplay.

Game Builds:

[Cubic Adventures](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g6KfLxFoApQ-GKCYQ5XZuv-kHYehhCfI?usp=sharing)

I have many more side projects which are not necessarily viable as standalone apps, these include fields such as path finding, terrain generation, shaders and more. For more information just ask via [my gmail](mailto:jasonaleroux2@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Github%20Projects).
